# quote-generator
First project for JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio

The project utilizes a public & free API to grab a random quote. It then displays that quote as well as a button to tweet out that quote. An additional button will retrieve another new quote.

## Customizations
- Switched the API used in the tutorial to one with quotes from Game of Thrones
- Created my own loader
